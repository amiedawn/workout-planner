# Workout Planner

As a person who wants to workout using an on-demand class website, I want an application that helps schedule workout plans so that I can have variety and track which plan I like best.

## Description

When you visit the site, you’ll see four categories of workout classes available: Strength Training, Cardio, Core Conditioning, and Toning. Click on “Explore Classes” on a specific category card and you’ll be prompted to create an account or log into your existing account.

After signing in, you’ll see a list of available classes in each category. Select the classes that interest you to add to your workout plan.

Then, visit your dashboard to see all the workout plans you selected.
There is a link on the dashboard to a page that allows you to edit or delete a plan, comment on a plan and view all comments related to the selected plan.

You can also view your calendar to see scheduled classes by day, week or month.

## Installation

You will need to add a .env file to connect to the tech_blog_db database and then install several dependencies: Node.js, express, sequelize, MySQL2, dotenv, bcrypt, express-handlebars, express-session, and connect-session-sequelize. Once dependencies have been installed, you may run the application in the terminal by typing “node start”. If you choose to have some sample data in the blog to start with, you may load the test data by running "npm run seeds" before starting the server.
