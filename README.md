# Workout Planner

As a person who wants to workout using an on-demand class website, I want an application that helps schedule workout plans so that I can have variety and track which plan I like best.

## Description

When you visit the site, you’ll see four categories of workout classes available: Strength Training, Cardio, Core Conditioning, and Toning. Click on “Explore Classes” on a specific category card and you’ll be prompted to create an account or log into your existing account.

After signing in, you’ll see a list of available classes in each category. Select the classes that interest you to add to your workout plan.

Then, visit your dashboard to see all the workout plans you selected.
There is a link on the dashboard to a page that allows you to edit or delete a plan, comment on a plan and view all comments related to the selected plan.

You can also view your calendar to see scheduled classes by day, week or month.
